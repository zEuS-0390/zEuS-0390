# Hi! I'm zEuS0390

## About me 
My passion is to create applications and explore different things.Â I practice every day to become more proficient on my current skills. Having a lack of resources does not really bother me, as long as there is a working and compatible computer with an internet, I would be able to do the work as much as I can. I also teach others not only to share my knowledge to them, but also to improve myself. If you want to know more about me and my works, check out my portfolio [here](https://zEuS0390.github.io).

## Present Skills
The programming languages in my development journey at the moment are mostly in C/C++ and Python, but prior to my long experience I can adapt.<br>
